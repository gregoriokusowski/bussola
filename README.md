      context: profile
      location: kubernetes_cluster
      team: user_profile_team
    dependsOn:
    - avatar_database
```

### Compile

```bash
go build cmd/main.go
```

```

And convert your .dot file into png/svg/etc.

```bash
cat your_data.yaml | ./main -directives a,b,c | pbcopy
```

and throw your results to http://www.webgraphviz.com/ or something similar


### Options

#### Directives

In order to nest your units inside different contexts, you can use the `-directives` option with `d1,d2,d3` syntax.

#### Filtering

You can filter your data by using the `-filter` cli option. The syntax is `k1:v1,v2;k2:v3` and will query your metadata.
